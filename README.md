# NoctAct-HAR
My final year college project on **Human Action Recognition in Dark(HAR)**.

## 📘 Final Year Project Report
This is a short report about the custom dataset we created in college for HAR in low-light environments.

The dataset contains videos recorded by us in low-light using mobile cameras, along with some videos taken from **ARID dataset**, which we modified later using some transformation techniques.

It has total of **6613 videos** across **12 distinct classes**:
**Boxing, Drink, Lifting Weights, Picking, Push, Receiving the Phone, Run, Stand, Throwing objects, Walking on Stairs, Walking with Flashlight, Waving**.

The dataset used in this project is uploaded on Kaggle. The dataset link is provided below, along with a sample image from the dataset.
